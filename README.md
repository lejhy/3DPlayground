# 3DPlayground
Exploring OpenGL, basically creating a 3D engine from scratch and learning on the go. I am mostly quided by the brilliant tutorials at [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/), but other resources proved very useful as well. 

Ultimately it should be a fully functional and easy to implement engine for any game or program that I might create in the future.
